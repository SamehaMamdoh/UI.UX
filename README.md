# FixSense 
______________
FixSense is a mobile app that helps car owners understand car problems easily.

When a user notices an issue with their car, they can open the app and describe what is happening, such as a strange sound or a warning light. The app suggests possible reasons for the problem and explains what the user should do next in a simple way.

FixSense also shows nearby repair centers so the user can quickly find a trusted place to fix the car.

The goal of FixSense is to reduce stress, save time, and help users make better decisions before going to a mechanic.
